This project analyzes a dataset related to obesity, focusing on factors affecting Body Mass Index (BMI) using R. It begins with data preparation, where the raw dataset is loaded, and new variables such as BMI are calculated alongside discrete values for certain factors. Exploratory data analysis includes examining the dataset's structure and generating visualizations like histograms of BMI and age, with log transformations applied to normalize the data. An initial linear regression model investigates relationships between log-transformed BMI and various predictors, including age, gender, and dietary habits, while checking for multicollinearity. The model is refined through stepwise regression and the exploration of interaction terms, followed by the inclusion of second-order terms to capture nonlinear relationships. Model evaluation involves residual analysis and a 70-30 training and testing data split, with metrics such as Adjusted R-Squared and Mean Squared Error (MSE) calculated to assess predictive accuracy. The project aims to provide insights into the factors contributing to obesity, informing public health strategies and personal lifestyle choices.
